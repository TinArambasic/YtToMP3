# YtToMP3
.exe file with source code that downloads youtube videos as mp3 with provided youtube link to a specified folder

NOTE: the .exe file can probably run without anything installed, but to ensure that errors dont happen in the app, do the following steps

1. Install python
2. run terminal commands : pip install pytube moviepy 
			   pip install --upgrade pip
3. install FFmpeg from ffmpeg.org (You can follow this step guide for windows installation www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows)
4. check if ffmeg works correctly :
		Open a new CMD terminal
		run command: ffmpeg -version
5. run YoutubeToMP3.exe
6. Enjoy :)

I have provided the source code if you desire to make the exe file yourself or if you want to upgrade the app
